            <h2>About Natasha</h2>
                <p>I'm one of those mythical "locals" who didn't transplant to Seattle. I grew up in Kent, WA but have lived in the city for 8 wonderful years. Before seeking a career in tech I worked in management, insurance, and the service industry. Learning to code is very different than anything I've tried before and I'm really enjoying the challenge.</p>
                <p>Things I enjoy when not in front of a computer: Like any good PNWer, I like hiking, camping, and enjoying a well earned beer. Now that venues are opening up, I'm really excited to see live music again! I'm also passionate about my coed flag football teams. Growing up, I always wanted to play, but there were few opportunities for girls in my town. Signing up for flag was like a dream come true! Now I captain my own team, I support a growing female flag league, and may join a female tackle league next year as a Corner.</p>
